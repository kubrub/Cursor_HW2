Refactor your “Calculator” so it would comply with OOP principles: 
  - refactor your calculator to different classes. 
  - include and implement at least one Interface
  - don't forget to encapsulate your data (use access modifiers) 
  - try to use inheritance  

Add messages for a user so it would be more user-friendly
